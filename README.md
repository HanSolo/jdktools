## JDKTools

JDKTools is a collection of classes that can be helpful when working with OpenJDK related things.

It contains classes like:
- Architecture
- Bitness
- OperatingSystem
- ArchiveType
- FPU
- HashAlgorithm
- LibCType
- ReleaseStatus
- PackageType
- SignatureType
- TermOfSupport
- Verification

and others.

The idea is to have a common set of classes that can be used in different libraries.
